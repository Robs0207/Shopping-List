# Shopping List App Challenge

This repo contains starter files for the *Shopping List App* challenge in Thinkful's Front End Web Development course.

Included Javascript and jQuery coding in the index.js file in order to get a working copy of the 
*Shopping List App*.

The coding included:

- jQuery event listeners in order to react to adding an item to the grocery list, crossing of an item, restoring an ietm and delting an item.
- jQuery was used for the DOM manipulation to dynamically add html coding to depict the state changes of the grocery items.
- JS was used to handle the conditional flow between the deletion, crossing of and restoring of an item.
